# S3

## Basics

S3 is object based &rarr; Simple key, value store:
* Key: Name of the object (S3 is lexicographically ordered by the keys)
* Value: Data as sequence of bytes
* Version ID: important for versioning
* Metadata
* Subresources: Access Control Lists (definition of permissions), Torrent

## Data Consistency

* PUTS (new objects): Read after Write consistency
* Overwrite PUTS & DELETES: Eventual consistency (can take time to propagate)
